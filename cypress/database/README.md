# `db` Folder

The `db` folder contains all database-related files and resources for the project. Its contents typically include:

- **migrations/**: Database migration scripts for schema changes.
- **seeds/**: Seed files to populate the database with initial or test data.
- **models/**: ORM models or schema definitions representing database tables.
- **config/**: Configuration files for database connections and environments.
- **utils/**: Helper scripts for database operations (optional).

Use this folder to manage and organize all database logic, ensuring a clear separation from application code.
